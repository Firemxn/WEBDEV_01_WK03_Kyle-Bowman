        <p>
            I'm Kyle, and I currently live in Hammond, Louisiana. I've been an ironworker for about 8 years now, but my goal is to have acareer within the computer science field. I've always had a passion for IT, and I'm very good with technology. I always say my number one hobby is HALO, I enjoy gaming for fun & competitvely. I've been takng classes in-between working, so I'm slowly but surely making my way towards completing my degree. I'm looking forward to what this class has to offer.
